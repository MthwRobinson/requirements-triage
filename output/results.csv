Testing shows the SSE2 implementation cannot handle unaligned data. Testing on an old 32-bit VIA C7-D (SSE, SSE2, SSE3 only) reveals the following. It looks like the pointer in ECX is unaligned. It makes sense since we put the byte array on the stack.        The `movdqa` is move double quad word aligned. We can side step it by aligning our buffers in `validat3.cpp` and documenting the requirement. We can also switch to `movdqu`, which is the unaligned version of the instruction.    SHA512 also suffers unaligned access when using `paddq`. Its a tougher problem because there is no unaligned version.    Now, the devious thing about this is, `GetOptimalAlignment()` is a member function.

"multilabel classification: Graph free memory to find out when memory is tight --- When monitoring an application, it is quite important to know when memory usage is too high - either to foresee a OutOfMemoryError threat or to see whether there is a memory leak. For this the memory usage diagram is quite interesting, but it is not very useful when the application is generating lots of garbage that is quickly collected, since you can't see how much of the used memory is garbage and how much is permanently stuck. Currently, the only way to get a warning would be to check the garbage collection time diagram, but this is probably just a crude warning minutes before the crash.  So I feel there is some more information needed. This could be a diagram of one of the following: 1. The memory usage just after the last Full GC. This would exclude all garbage from the display.

My feeling is that the `linter-eslint` linter isn't being triggered for the `HTML (Riot tag)` syntax and also for the HTML syntax.

Apply both an image filter and resizeFilter to an image.  2. Shrink the image using the corner controls  3. Serialize, then load the canvas by clicking the 'To JSON', then 'Load JSON' buttons    ## Expected Behavior  The image should resize as expected while keeping the image filter. The stringified canvas should also load exactly as it appeared before being serialized.    ## Actual Behavior  Shrinking the image beyond a certain point causes the image filter to disappear. When the canvas is serialized and then loaded while in this state, the loaded canvas makes the image filter work again, but the image becomes cropped.

Implementations on CPUs could achieve that by adding inner, constant-size loops and pragmas. (Example: loop 1 to n with n non-constant will not likely be vectorized, a loop 1 to n%8 with inner constant loops 0 to 7 might be more likely be vectorized.) Also, users could use that feature to avoid bank conflicts in one thread per block access schemes and it might be very useful on GPUs for synchronization and ptx/asm-specific calls.

Consider this very basic tag which renders any nested HTML:        If you use the `yield` tag, any reference to `this` inside the yielding block refers to the tag which has the `yield` tag.

Therefore the maximum value which can be stored rises from 65534 (=2^16-2) to 262142 (=2^18-2). You can also use other bit combinations like 20/12 which would allow to store values of up to 1048574 (=2^20-2) at the expense of reducing the range of the delta value.  However, the new getToWeight function may be slightly slower since it has to get both, the backward and delta weight, and add them together.

For example: - Resetting a generator graph to its initial state - Copying a generator graph - Initializing the entire chain with a particular context (smart pointer), rather than passing it down via `tick`   - This could solve the mutex issue, since each generator would have a smart pointer reference to its parent synthesis context.  In general, having each generator hang on to a list of its inputs would make the whole generator graph more accessible for these types of operations, and would be transparent to anyone who is just building synths - it introduces a bit of complexity on the `Tonic_` side of things, but IMO that's acceptable",question,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,feature,feature,1,0

Currently the portable_binary archive uses a lazy optimization that makes for a different wire format on big and little endian machines.  Hence, if a big- and little-endian machine both sign the same data structure serialized with a PortableBinaryOutputArchive, the actual signed bytes will be different.  In the best case multiple copies of the same message can be sent around, which is wasteful.  In other cases, things like threshold signatures, in which multiple machines of possibly different endianness collaborate to sign a single message, are effectively impossible with cereal.

"multilabel classification:  Improve Salsa20 implementation and test cases --- The Botan team uncovered an overflow bug in their ChaCha SIMD implementation. Crypto++ based its code on the Botan team's implementation and shared the bug.    The problem arose when the low-word counter wrapped and the high word counter was incremented. The counters themselves were OK; the problem was with an intermediate value that did not properly manage the carry on the wrap.    The ChaCha problem got us curious about the Salsa implementation. We downloaded the ECRYPT reference implementation and modified it to allow seek'ing. We then generated some test cases to seek {1,2,16} blocks prior to the wrap.    <strike>It seems the Crypto++ SIMD implementation of Salsa has the same issue, give or take.

"multilabel classification: Static SHA::Transform fails on Intel SHA cpu's --- Below are from self tests that exercise `SHA::Transform` (`SHA` is `SHA1`, `SHA256`, etc), which is a static member function. The code path for `SHA::Transform` is a little different than the code path when using an SHA object with `Update` and `Final`.    `HASH::InitState` and `HASH::Transform` are unique to hashes which derive from `IteratedHashWithStaticTransform`. Most hash classes simply derive from `IteratedHash`. The reason for the static `HASH::Transform` is, some classes like SEAL and MDC, call the transform function directly. The static functions allow the other classes to use, say, a user supplied key as state instead of the traditional SHA initialization values.    The self tests are fine on non-SHA-accelerated processors. However, due to the slightly different code paths, when ARM or Intel SHA is available, the code misses a required endian conversion.

Currently the atomic operations are very slow if they are emulated (e.g., with `omp  critical section`) this result in code which is not performance portable. Alpaka knows best which layer (grid, block, thread) needs which type of atomics.  We should add to all alpaka atomics a hint from the user in which scope the operation must be atomic.    Scopes can be: alpaka::Threads - operation is atomic between threads in a block alpaka::Blocks - operation is atomic between blocks in a grid alpaka::Grids - operation is atomic between grids on a device  Why the scope should not be based on memory (e.g., shared memory, global memory)? The reason is that global memory can used by the user in that way that the domains of the blocks are independent. With this strategy and if the user defines  that the scope is `::alpaka::Threads` the atomic inside alpaka can be `atomic::AtomicNoO",feature,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,feature,feature,1,1

multilabel classification: ALT algorithm for a more dynamic speed up --- I've developed over the last months a new speed up algorithm (actually the initial prototype was done in a day ;))    Enable with:  - `prepare.lm.weightings=fastest` in the config.properties  - append `&ch.disable=true` if CH is enabled    The speedup is 17x faster compared to the fastest flexible algorithm (A* with a distance estimate) for German wide random requests and 16 landmarks. It is 25x faster with 32 landmarks.    The per-request memory improvements are in a similar range i.e. ~X times faster means ~X times less visited nodes. The static memory requirements are comparable to CH for world wide case and 16 landmarks. More memory for more landmarks.    Some other good properties are:  - Optimal routes. 'heuristical nature' can be introduced but yields only a minor speedup (e=1.3) and if epsilon similar chosen like suggested in #506 (e=1.6) it is even much worse.  - The LM preparation can be parallelized and should be possible within a few minutes even for world wide coverage  -,feature,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,feature,feature,1,1

"multilabel classification: Feature request: Add ability for Art Directed images using the  <picture> / <source> elements --- Hi, it's great that `srcset` has been implemented in version 3 for responsive images. It would nice to allow for the `<picture>` element to be used for [Art directed](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/picture-element/) responsive images.      I think in this case, the `<source>` element would also be required so this might end up being a pretty big lift to implement.

"multilabel classification: Change the behavior of interactiveAutoClose --- Here is a suggestion to change how tooltips close when using `interactiveAutoClose = false`, feedback is welcome before implementation.  Currently, `interactiveAutoClose` only takes effect when the trigger event is 'hover' and if the mouse has actually come over the tooltip to start interaction.  I suggest that 1) interactiveAutoClose applies as soon as the tooltip is shown, and 2) also applies when the trigger is 'click'.  Basically, it means that when `interactiveAutoClose = false` and once the tooltip has shown, only a call to the `hide` method could close it.  As for the 'click' event case : currently, when a tooltip is shown, you have to click again on the element to hide it. Besides, setting `interactiveAutoClose = false` will currently not prevent the tooltip from being closed by the user.  What I suggest for 'click' is : another click anywhere in the page will close the tooltip.

We're using Python 2.7, and it appears that the Pendulum formatters return regular (ASCII) strings. However, those strings contain Unicode characters in some instances.

In other words, it's improperly stuffing the Unicode character é in an ASCII string. Attempting to cast this invalid ASCII string as a Unicode string will bomb:        Of course, casting ASCII strings as Unicode is exactly what Jinja2 does, so this exception crashes the entire page.

"multilabel classification: reduce memory requirements --- This can be done in one of three ways.     We could re-introduce numeric column types like integer and float.  We could compress the data.  We could use other primitive types inside NumericColumn     Each has benefits. Adding an integer class would not only ensure that ints only use 4 bytes, but also provide automatic formatting for integer values (i.e. no decimal points in display.      The difficulty is that the current code has made it difficult to add a new numeric column type. Mostly because the combination of the NumberColumn interface and the use of generic types, makes Number column difficult to subclass. The complex hierarchy of interfaces doesn't help, several like (NumberMapFunctions) have double iterators, which conflict with other numeric types.    Compressing the data is a second possibility.

The string returned will replace the value of the variable.    `replaceAnnotations` is intended to be piped:        `replacer` could look like this:        ### Some more details    - Annotation options:      - If an annotation does not specify options, the replacer will be given `undefined`.      - Everything within the round braces will be passed to",feature,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,feature,feature,1,1

They make heavy use of virtual calls which are unnecessary (for example `on_number=void(double num)` instead of `if (variable.isDouble()) x = variable.getDouble()`  The JSON spec at least is very light and it's fairly easy to implement a parser if a streaming JSON parser does not already exist.",discussion,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,feature,feature,1,0

The issue is also discussed here: https://forum.ghost.org/t/featured-image-in-post-adding-alt-text-or-captions/892    ### To Reproduce    I have a very tediuous workaround, which even involves editing my theme:    1. Edit my theme to not display the post-image in the main view  2. Create a post with a post image  3. Add the same image as the very first thing in the post  4. Specify an excerpt as the {{excerpt}} macro includes the Figure caption from the image    I haven't been able to find other ways to include such a Figure, and it seems unreasonable to edit the theme and having specify the excerpt manually for posts.    ### Technical details:    * Ghost Version: 2.19.3-alpine (from DockerHub)  * Node Version: 10  * Browser/OS: Firefox  * Database: SQLite",feature,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,feature,feature,1,1

From this point, the system calls a dispatcher which includes a 'controller' file depending on the URL (validated against a statically built array), represented here by b.php. As this is data driven, Psalm can't see it.    It is safe to assume that all files always get included, as this will not cause name collision, the lazy loading is done as an optimisation.

Unfortunately we're moving from Python 2 to 3 and this includes activating `PYTHONHASHSEED` by default. We're currently trying to add it on Python 2 so that we're ready.  Since `PYTHONHASHSEED` means that dictionary iteration order is random, it means that anything that depends on this breaks.

"multilabel classification: opts mapped to the tag on every update, tag.opts always carries initial state? --- ### 1. Describe your issue:    This is simply an inquiry since I couldn't find anything on this on the documentation. Please see this plnkr: http://plnkr.co/edit/FKSVv0IRHgeWTKcQP1ER?p=preview    The output:      So the behaviour seems to be as follows: When a tag is mounted with `opts` these opts will always stay on the tag as `tag.opts`. They represent the initial state of the tag when mounted. Now when `tag.update(opts)` is called, the new opts passed to the tag via `update` are mapped to the tag itself, resulting in the tag possessing the same fields as the passed opts?

So `<div id=whatever></div>` becomes `<div></div>`.    ### Steps to reproduce the actual/current behavior    Create model with a Markdown field and enter some content. Anywhere within enter `<div id=whatever></div>`. Save the post. Keystone reports that the post is suc",question,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,bug,bug,0,0

"multilabel classification: How to make an isomorphic component that does HTTP requests --- 1. Describe your issue:    As a proof of concept, I'm building a search component which makes requests to a search results service.  It works just fine in client-side mode, but rendering it server-side is less straightforward due to the lack of `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest` in node (it throws an error due to fetch/XHR being undefined).    I can see a case for doing the same request in node, then adding the search results to the tag (ex:`riot.renderAsync('search-component', searchResults)`) but that seems like unfortunate duplication to me.  The component already understands how to make requests to the search endpoint, the server-side renderer shouldn't have to understand that too.

It's the **64-bit x64** 7.0.0 library that is slower.    I suspect the performance drop was introduced with library version 6.0.0 that has the SIMD rewrite in `sha-simd.cpp`.  It looks like the older 5.6.5 used sha256 assembly code in `x64dll.asm`.

After chatting on gitter, I came to understand there's no synchronization going on in ChakraCore and it's the host's responsibility to handle that.

I believe it works like:  - If the isolate is already locked to the current thread, increment a counter (a bit like a `JsAdd`)  - Once the Locker unlocks (instance drops out of scope), decrement the counter (like `JsRelease`)  - At `0`, this Isolate is ready to be locked onto a different thread (or the same, really)    This allows efficient usage within the same thread, but also a seamless experience across threads (when using the Locker.)",discussion,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,feature,bug,0,0
"multilabel classification: Using hoverIntent to trigger `hover` tooltips --- **TL;DR**: I think [hoverIntent](http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html)'s approach is much better than plain delays for opening popups because it triggers fewer false positives.  Tooltipster's current behavior, if I'm not mistaken, is to open popups after a certain time their associated element has been hovered. This works well enough in many cases, but it triggers many false positives in others (i.e. the user was just moving the cursor around and didn't really want a popup to appear).  There are two examples where this is more noticeable. If we have one big tooltipstered element, it will more probably than not open a popup even if the mouse cursor is just passing through it because it accumulates enough time. ~~Another case is when there are multiple (smaller) elements close together and the cursor is passing through them. Even if the user spends only some milliseconds hovering over each of them, time will eventually accumulate and a popup will open on the last one",feature,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,feature,feature,1,1

I do all my active development on my bitbucket repository (https://bitbucket.org/Starnick/assimpnet), which has all my other projects. Before anyone says to switch entirely to github, I originally was on googlecode but switched to bitbucket because I preferred their services over github.    However, this does cause issues. People mistake the github repo that you guys imported from googlecode as mine and I don't actually administer it. So a few ideas:    1. Delete it outright, the main assimp repository already points to my bitbucket repository.    2. Maintain a git mirror of my bitbucket repo. Although this may mean it'll get out of date.    3.

"multilabel classification: Locust exits with 1 on timeouts / errors --- Depending on how others are deploying this tool from the command line it may be a non-issue, but it's causing problems for us.

By the time we exit in this case, the entire test was already completed and requests were sent. Whatever downstream metrics systems will have valid data, etc. If we retry based on a non-zero exit code, we run the test twice. Users of the tool should probably be doing something more intelligent downstream to determine if the test was a failure or not than if there was at least 1 error. So why exit with an error code?    Two initial ideas that could improve the behavior (either or both would work):  1) Use a return code that's unique to this kind of failure but not really, so it can be handled and ignored / logged with the correct criticality  2) Add a new command line parameter that is a threshold for failur",feature,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,feature,feature,1,1

However, it doesn't seem to take into account the elevation data when calculating the time / duration of the `Path` or `Instruction`.

At the beginning I thought that there was a bug in the time calculation process, and that it didn't show the correct time for reversed routes.

After examining the behavior and generated code, there were a handful of observations:    * Retry overhead and book-keeping contributed about 40% of the high level C++ code overall  * Exception frame setup and tear down in GenerateBlock contributed about 70% of the [compiler generated] ASM code in GenerateBlock  * It was more efficient to retry a failed gen immediately rather than trying to track it through a variable like m_retires  * Hel",feature,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,feature,feature,1,1

When setting `min_wait` and `max_wait` values in a `TaskSet` class, the values seem to be ignored and the default values of 1000 (from the `Locust` class) are used instead.    I've done some digging into this and I _think_ I know where the problem lies. The `TaskSet`'s `wait_function` is automatically set to the locust's `wait_function` if undefined, but the locust's `wait_function` was defined as a lambda using its own `min_wait` and `max_wait` values. As such, the `TaskSet`'s `min_wait` and `max_wait` value have no effect.    You can get around this by assigning a new lambda`wait_function` to the `TaskSet`, but this defeats the purpose of being able to override the `min_wait` and `max_wait` values.    ### Expected behavior    When setting a min_wait and max_wait value of 10000 in a TaskSet class, tasks for each Locust should be spawned 10 seconds apart    ### Actu",bug,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,bug,bug,0,0

multilabel classification: restructure the alpaka code hierarchies --- Alpaka has a well structured hierarchy of folders and namespaces. In the current structure all backends life in one folder tree. The advantage of this structure is that you have the implementation of traits for all backends near to each other. A disadvantage is that it is hard to isolate all code to a corresponding backend.    My suggestion is to restructure the folders and group all code for a specific backend under a subfolder.    suggestion:      Such a change will also allow that we create a unified code for hip/cuda without the limitation that we con only activate hip or cuda within a binary. This is possible by adding a define which specify which backend should be used before we include all files of the backend. Than the define is changed to the next backend type and we can include it also.    cc-ing: @ComputationalRadiationPhysics/alpaka-developers @tdd11235813,question,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,feature,feature,1,0

"multilabel classification: Incorrect behavior in DailyRollingFileAppender::close() --- Currently `DailyRollingFileAppender::close()` uncoditionally rolls over its files. This leads to a double rollover when used in a typical server application which uses `fork()` to put itself to background: first time the class rolls over when a parent process exits (usually quite soon after forking the child service process) and then when child (== actual server process) exits.  What's worth the actual logging is performed to a backup log file, while the regular log file remains empty (the parent process moves the regular log file to backup on its exit, and the child process doesn't detect this).  A possible workaround/solution would be not to roll logfiles upon `close()` or maybe selectively skip rollover stage when such a use pattern is active.",feature,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,bug,bug,0,1

Make the `target()` parameter of `@Mapping` optional, so that we can simply use `@Mapping(source=foo, ignore=true)`  1. `target()` should only be allowed to be empty when `unmappedSourcePolicy != IGNORE`, `ignore = true` and `source` has some value, otherwise it should not be allowed.  1.

"multilabel classification: New Generic.WhiteSpace.ArbitraryParenthesesSpacing sniff --- While working on the big WP Core auto-fixing project, I realized there was no sniff available to check the whitespace around arbitrary parentheses. So, here goes.    This new sniff checks the spacing on the **_inside_** of arbitrary parentheses.  A conscious choice has been made not to check on the outside as this would very quickly conflict with other sniffs.    Arbitrary parentheses, for the purposes of this sniff, are all parentheses which do not belong to a control structure, function declaration, function call or language construct.  This is to prevent conflicts and duplication with rules for those type of constructs.    **Notes:**  * The sniff will throw (fixable) errors when an incorrect amount of whitespace (too much/too little) has been found on the inside or the parenthesis.  * The sniff will throw a warning when an empty set of arbitrary parentheses is encountered.  * The desired amount of whitespace on the inside of the parentheses can be configured using the `spacingInside",feature,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,feature,feature,1,1

"multilabel classification: binary serialization of bitset does not compile --- Hello,  first of all, I want to mention how great your library is. I have been using it for quite a while in a couple of projects of mine, and it very easy to use.  Unfortunately, I stumbled upon some issues using bitsets. Here is a minimal working example that shows the issue I have:    The above code (using XML archives) compiles, and runs as expected (thanks to @erichkeane comment below. If you modify the code to use the binary archives (change the typedefs at the top, it will not compile, unless you also include the types/strings.hpp header.

I really enjoy riot and the experience it provides to us developers, so I hope you guys take the following into consideration.    First, refs do not work the same way as tags used to work--you now must wait for the mounted event. Not only does this make the code verbose, this also complicates templating as you must check for the ref in the parent's template before accessing the ref's attributes.    Second, why remove support for spaced observable events? Now that the update and mount events are triggered separately, listening to multiple events in one place would be very nice. It feels like this feature was removed right when it was needed.    2. Can you reproduce the issue?    As mentioned by @Infeligo in #2146, when accessing a ref's attribute in a template expression:        It throws an error since the ref is not available until the mount event, so we must check for the ref every time",discussion,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,question,feature,1,0

However, just changing that naïvely doesn't work either, I *think* because the loop that is supposed to bind the query parameters has the same issue. *EDIT*: Update() looks like it might suffer from a similar problem with the parameter binding.    Here's a small commit which reproduces the problem with `remove` in the unit test code:    https://github.com/BardurArantsson/sqlite_orm/commit/7f0c9de95b8e3d12f6318f28543fa8be722f1051",bug,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,bug,bug,0,0

"multilabel classification: Custom names in varying.def --- I would like to use custom names for vertex attributes (for various reasons). Currently it is possible only on DirectX, not on OpenGL (and I suppose also for other non-DX apis) : attributes should start by `a_` and instance data with `i_`, which is exactly what I want to avoid. Thankfully, due to the semantic system it is completely possible.    I identified two problems: the compiler, and the runtime.     - For the compiler, the key is that input is a varying unless it is an input to a vertex shader (in which case it cannot be a varying). Which means we just need to change `shaderc.cpp:1472`, from            if (0 == strncmp(name, a_, 2)          ||  0 == strncmp(name, i_, 2))       to:            if (shaderType == 'v')       (this is compatible with previous naming conventions).     - For the runtime, in `renderer_gl.cpp:4325` (for example), the attribute arrays for a program are filled, but they just try to find the location using predefined names for semantics, completely ignoring",feature,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,feature,feature,1,1

This is due to the following. By now, there is a standardized interface for complex numbers in `std::complex<RealType>` which ships with abs, exp and trigonometric functions. Unfortunately, the STL version of std::complex is not usable in CUDA code as all its functionality is not marked as a `__device__` function. However, in [thrust/complex.h][thrust-complex], there exists an implementation which is suitable for all accelerators and furthermore binary compatible to the `std::complex` implementations (and other complex types like `cuComplex/cuDoubleComplex`). The only problem is that this is only available by default when CUDA is enabled. So, it is not possible to use this directly when only relying on alpaka by now.

This is done by `@Mapping( target = tbean.propX.propX1, source = sbean.propY.propY1.propY11 )`. For all clarity: it does not seem to make sense add an ignore option like for instance: `@Mapping( target = tbean.propX.propX2, ignore = true )`, since this property would not have been mapped anyway.

The projects are called ports' and they include: - Fink - Gentoo/Alt - Homebrew - MacPorts - Pkgsrc - Rudix  Some of the ports provide GCC, but they do not enable `init_priority` support and subsequently fail the compile.

It would be better if we can take advantage of custom elements to mount/dismount it automatically when the tags is attached to/detached from the DOM.    2. Can you reproduce the issue?  Create a custom Tag, then `riot.mount(*);`.    3. On which browser/OS does the issue appear?  As of 2/6/2016, all the platforms Riot.js runs on are covered under this issue.    4.

In an object graph, It would be nice to pass a source parameter (which is not a context) as context to a subordinate mapping method.     To control this, this could be done by adding an attribute to an `@IterableMapping`, `@MapMapping`, `@BeanMapping` or `@ValueMapping` method.    A typical use case would be to retain for instance a collection for use in the element mapping (or deeper down the object graph).",feature,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,feature,feature,1,1

"multilabel classification: WIP: Allow creation of custom, developer defined, field types --- ## Description of changes  This is a Work in Progress for allowing developer defined Field Types.  The new Type is bolted on by simply defining it as a new property on the `keystone.Field.Types` object.    The change to `createStaticRouter.js` allows defining the paths for browserify to import.    [Here is a gist with an example custom type](https://gist.github.com/timemachine3030/a13f93eb2b04c8ce2f23695787eb8d64)    ### Open Issues:  The inclusion of developer Types into the `/js/fields.js` browserify bundle is problematic with cashing. The `keystone.createKeystoneHash()` function needs updated to allow code level changes to the Column, Field, Filter, and Type files to rebuild the javascript.    An optimization may be to have `NODE_ENV=development` create a second bundle that builds faster (having less fields to load) and with every server restart. I'm open for suggestions.    ### Next Steps  After the change is reviewed and any open issues resolved  *  Add additional commits with pro",feature,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,feature,feature,1,1

"multilabel classification: Question regarding configuration of FileAppender and Appender in general --- Hi,  While using log4cplus, I came across the following two questions that might rather be of conceptual nature: - Is it intended that a file is only written to by exactly one FileAppender? Technically, it is possible that I specify the same filename in two different FileAppenders. In the `append` method of a FileAppender the output stream is only flushed if `UseLockFile` or `ImmediateFlush` is true and also `formatAndAppend` does not perform a flush by default. So, I guess that using the same file from two different FileAppenders is undefined behavior (if `immediateFlush` is not set). Could you may be comment on that? - I've noticed that for logging events that are propagated to ancestors, the logging level is ignored. E.g. if I set the root logger to level `INFO` and attach a console appender to it and issue a `DEBUG` event to a logger `some.logger` whose level is set to `DEBUG`, the root logger will still print this event to the console.

So this means the latest stable version detected is 1.1.2 (https://release-monitoring.org/project/1835/) which is from 2013.  So my question is, if the project considers the RC releases as final and stable? Are you at all planning to release final version (not RC) of the newer versions (1.1.3, 1.2.0) of log4cplus?  PS: I'm not sure which place is considered as official, where the project lives. Is if GitHub or sourceforge?

For each tunnel (or bridge) edge, the algorithm first finds a connected component of tunnel (bridge) edges. Thus we can find inner and outer nodes of the tunnel. Outer nodes have tunnel and non-tunnel edges whereas inner nodes only have tunnel edges. Outer nodes are considered to be on the Earth surface, therefore we can trust the elevation provider for their elevation.  Once we've found inner and outer nodes, we'll interpolate elevations of inner nodes based on the elevations of the outer nodes. Interpolation method depends on the number of outer nodes.

JSON archive's compilation problems on Mac 2. XML archive's problem of serializing space characters and space-only strings.  And some tweaks have been made: 1.

The upgrade path was intended to be approximately:    * Upgrade to 1.6.0+ and switch to LegacyBooleanAttribute atomically. Roll that out everywhere. This causes readers to support both integers and booleans in DynamoDB.  * Switch to BooleanAttribute and roll that out everywhere.

Each expression has a pointer to a DOM node. On each run these expressions are evaluated and compared to the values in the DOM. When a value has changed the corresponding DOM node is updated. In a way Riot also has a virtual DOM, just a much simpler one.  That sounds like the _real_ DOM is scanned for any out-of-date values. I checked the source and it does indeed appear that Riot is [looping](https://github.com/riot/riot/blob/master/riot.js#L1818) through [old/new value comparisons](https://github.com/riot/riot/blob/master/riot.js#L1833). To me, that's the definition of _dirty checking_.

Right now this is really simplistic and only a brief draft of how this could look like. As usual I like to discuss a draft first, before implementing too much detail :). However, the shown implementation matches the correct Street, for the example in #549, see the new IT.

The simplification removes the previously added code in favour of skipping to the end of a statement as soon as an assignment operator has been found.    This might also make the sniff marginally faster as the tokens between the assignment operator and the end of the statement will no longer be examined.    N.B.: The reason for going one back from the end of the assignment (line 241), is that otherwise the code addressing the issue covered by the unit test on line 220 / added in commit 579d39cac3163bdf05ce1b50a7e470acd452735b would not be triggered, leading to incorrect results.

"multilabel classification: @template-extends expects multi-line input --- It appears that the docblock parser expects template-extends to be a multi-line annotation entry if the line following the declaration consists solely of a single *.    There's a php-cs-fixer rule (`phpdoc_separation`) that requires annotations of differing types be separated by a blank line.    If one declares the template annotations first, followed by property annotations, then the issue occurs.  The workaround is to declare `@template-extends` last, as the docblock parser likely interprets `*/` as there's no more annotations, go home.    Unless the docblock is parsed backwards, I suspect non-workaround solution to this may be impacted by/benefit from #1518 as docblock annotations *may* be valid at the start of a line in a multi-line annotation (e.g. a multi-line version of `array{@property:string}`).    * expects-multiline: https://psalm.dev/r/0077af5d32  * doesn't expect: https://psalm.dev/r/315044f3c9      > Psalm output (using commit 624c7bc):   >  > ERROR: InvalidDocblock - 12:",bug,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,bug,bug,0,0

I could probably work around this by creating a custom class holding three triangle indices with its own `serialize()` function, but this would require me to pass around this custom class everywhere in my API instead of a simple `std::array<int, 3>` that communicates its intent to the user much more directly - everybody knows at first glance what the type `std::array<int, 3>` is, while if it's a custom class, it creates an additional layer of abstraction and the user has to",discussion,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,feature,question,0,0

"multilabel classification: Improve using glog as cmake subproject --- Some glog users like to include it in sources and use `add_subdirectory`. However, that results in a problem: `install()` commands are processed and may interfere with other things.

This way `find_package(gflags)` does not run (which would fail), but `gflags` support is activated and `target_link_libraries(glog gflags)` runs successfully, because the target is defined    However, when `glog` calls `install(TARGETS glog EXPORTS glog-targets...)`, cmake wants `gflags` target installed in the same export set and, of course, fails.

"multilabel classification: Extend @internal syntax to encapsulate elements within a namespace --- It would be useful to be able to restrict the use of classes and other elements to within the library or submodule that they live in, particularly to allow changes to be made without breaking backwards compatibility. Although PHP has no concept of either a library or a submodule, the [@internal](https://docs.phpdoc.org/references/phpdoc/tags/internal.html) annotation can sometimes be used to achieve this.    Psalm interprets`@internal` as meaning that the declaring and calling code must not be in 'unrelated namepsaces', and emits issues as shown at https://psalm.dev/r/90a95c1dd8 .     However this only works because the two namespaces are completely unrelated, and so might not be usable if `Foo` and `Bat` were both written by members of the same organisation, or in the particular case of Drupal if `Foo` was part of Drupal Core, and `Bat` was part of a bespoke applications controller, since the Drupal docs encourage the use of related namespaces.
